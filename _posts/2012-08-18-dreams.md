My friend Sam Soffes argued that [App.net is not dreaming big enough](http://samsoff.es/posts/app-net-is-dreaming-small):

> If you're going to take the time to build a social network, Facebook's market should be what you're going after. Building Twitter for the tech elite seems super small.

I don't think this is their problem. Big ideas don't always start with what seem like the most ambitious ideas. It's impossible to predict what will take market share from Facebook and Twitter. It could be a better Facebook, it could be a different idea entirely.

Catering to the tech elite is not a bad short term strategy. It doesn't mean their plans aren't ambitious. Facebook started by catering to college students. Paul Graham puts it more clearly in his essay [Frighteningly Ambitious Start Up Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html):

> Don't worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don't get that initial core of users, there won't be a long term.
